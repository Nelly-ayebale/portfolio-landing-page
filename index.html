        <p>I have just began my journey at Moringa School and through this astounding marathon I have encountered very many experiences with learning how to code and moreso WEB DESIGN in particular.This has been and exciting journey and I have 
            come to aprehend my talents in the WEB DESIGN section with the help of my Technical Mentors and the research I carried out as I was faced with this topic.
            This was moreso on <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-tricks</a>. With all these efforts combined I was able to come up with a few website pages which included:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/animalshelter/">ANIMAL SHELTER.</a></li>
            <p>This project was created using HTML AND CSS languages. This project is a contribution to my progress in learning how to use floats
                in a given website.
            </p>
            <li> <a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/my-pet-1/">MY PET.</a></li>
            <p>In this project, I was able to write about my pet(SNOW) and I was still practicing while using HTML and CSS.However this project doesn't include any
                floats and designs because it was among my first projects while I was being introduced to Web designing and deploying my github page online.
            </p>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/photographer/">PHOTOGRAPHER.</a></li>
            <p>This Photographer project is a project I made about a photographer portfolio and in this particular project,I learnt how to include columns
                in the page and also further my practice on deploying my github page online.
            </p>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/myfirstwebpage/">MY FIRST WEBPAGE.</a></li> 
            <p>With all you need to know being in the description, I am new to the world of programming and code. This project was an illustration of 
                the beginning of my journey in the world of programming and in this I was assisted by Moringa School. In this project, I also learnt how to add 
                images to a page.

            <h2>I am a Ugandan 19 year old female and all my life I have lived and studed in Uganda. In this journey, I have encountered many experiences
            most especially in the job section. I have never had a full time job because most of the time I was in school which takes up around 3 months in a term
            with a 3 weeks holiday. However, in my holidays I would pick up part time jobs which I would do for a course of 3 weeks or 2 weeks in other areas.
            These jobs were not in big departments but more in a small department such as: Organising Files in a particular office, delivering files to another
            headquarter or department, handling the writing and signing off of receipts as well as handling the cashier at sometimes(This was rare.)
            I picked up many skills in this department such as: Communication skills, secretarial skills and in some cases I was able to exercise my Computer skills.

            </h2>
            <p>This was in organisations such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>MGS(U)LTD</li>
                <li>SAMEER AFRICA</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h2>I studied in a few schools for both my elementary and primary level as well as my secondary school where I finished my Alevel in 2019.
            In my elementary and Primary level, I was at GREENHILL ACADEMY where I finished my Primary 7 and advanced to KINGS'COLLEGE BUDO where I 
            began my Olevel in 2013 and finished Form 4 in 2017 thus graduating Olevel and advancing to Alevel which I did for 2 years and got my UACE
            Certificate for completing Form 6. In 2020, I had my vacation for 7 months and then I joined the Moringa School to advance my skills in Computer
            and Software Development.

            <p>On joining Moringa School, I was excited and happy that I was one step close to fulfilling my dreams being that I have always wanted to be 
            a Software Engineer. In this schhol I will learn about Programming while using some languages such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                </ul>
            When I graduate at the Moringa School, I plan on using my qualification to join University and acquire a degree in Software Engineering.
