        <p>I have just began my journey at Moringa School and through this astounding marathon I have encountered very many experiences with learning how to code and moreso WEB DESIGN in particular.This has been and exciting journey and I have 
            come to aprehend my talents in the WEB DESIGN section with the help of my Technical Mentors and the research I carried out as I was faced with this topic.
            This was moreso on <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-tricks</a>. With all these efforts combined I was able to come up with a few website pages which included:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/animalshelter/"></a></li>
            <p>This project was created using HTML AND CSS languages. This project is a contribution to my progress in learning how to use floats
                in a given website.
            </p>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/my-pet-1/>"></a></li>
            <p>In this project, I was able to write about my pet(SNOW) and I was still practicing while using HTML and CSS.However this project doesn't include any
                floats and designs because it was among my first projects while I was being introduced to Web designing and deploying my github page online.
            </p>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/photographer/"></a></li>
            <p>This Photographer project is a project I made about a photographer portfolio and in this particular project,I learnt how to include columns
                in the page and also further my practice on deploying my github page online.
            </p>
            <li><a href="//nelly-ayebale.github.io/myfirstwebpage/"></a></li> 
            <p>With all you need to know being in the description, I am new to the world of programming and code. This project was an illustration of 
                the beginning of my journey in the world of programming and in this I was assisted by Moringa School. In this project, I also learnt how to add 
                images to a page.
